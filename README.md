# odin-links-and-images
This is a repo on the Odin project on links and images
the <a> tag is used to show links
the "href" tag specifies the destiation link
the "target" attribute shows where the link will open. If it is blank it will open to the current tab
_self opens in the current tab
_blank opens in a new window
"rel" attribute shows the relationship between the current tab and the linked document
"noopener" value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened
"noreferrer" value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it
an example is <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me</a>
The main reason to use the above two values is security
ABSOLUTE LINKS provide links to other pages on the internet
RELATIVE LINKS provide links within the same website
